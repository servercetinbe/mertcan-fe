CSS Architecture: BEM-SMACSS-OOCSS
CSS architecture is a set of rules and methods used to organize and make your CSS files more structured and readable.
Basic Principles:
1-Modularity
2-Consistency
3-Scalability
4-Layering:



BEM (BLOCK-ELEMENT-MODIFIER) is a CSS architecture developed by Yandex.
BEM helps you write more consistent, organized, and readable code when writing CSS.
The main purpose is to increase the maintainability of CSS. It is used to describe the structures in HTML code and eliminate unnecessary code.
It increases the reusability of code and allows us to add and remove components with a component-based approach.
Naming is done with classes instead of IDs.
__ (double underscore): indicates an element.
-- (double hyphen): indicates a modifier. It styles the component.
- (hyphen): used for word concatenation.
