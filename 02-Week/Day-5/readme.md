What is the difference between FE frameworks, why can I choose React or Vue, compare them.

# React vs Vue: A Comparison

React and Vue are both popular JavaScript frameworks used for building user interfaces (UI) in web applications. While they share the same goal of simplifying UI development, there are some differences between them.

## React

React, developed by Facebook, is considered a library that provides the foundational functionality for creating UI. It works by adding components to a project and uses a syntax called JSX, which allows for writing HTML-like code within JavaScript. This makes UI components more flexible and powerful.

React utilizes state and props. State holds the data of a component and is used to change the component's state. Props are used to pass data to a component. State management tools like Redux or Context API can be used with React. Additional libraries can be used for routing, state management, form handling, API requests, and more.

## Vue

Vue, on the other hand, is a framework that can be used for both UI and application logic. It allows for more traditional usage of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without the need for additional libraries for routing, state management, form handling, or API requests. Vue is known for its simplicity and ease of learning, making it a good choice for beginners.

In terms of ecosystem, Vue has a smaller ecosystem compared to React and Angular. This means there are fewer third-party libraries and plugins available for Vue. Vue CLI is the official command-line interface tool for creating Vue applications. Vue Router and Vuex are commonly used with Vue for routing and state management, respectively.

## Performance

When it comes to performance, React is generally better suited for large and complex applications, while Vue performs well in smaller and medium-sized applications.

## Summary

In summary, React is more suitable for larger and complex applications, offering a wide range of library support and customization options. Vue, on the other hand, is better suited for smaller and medium-sized applications, providing a simpler and faster development experience.

Please note that the code examples you provided are valid for React and Vue respectively, showcasing how to create a simple counter component in each framework.
