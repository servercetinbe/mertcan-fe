// React and Vue are JavaScript frameworks. Both aim to simplify UI development for web applications.

// React is developed by Facebook. It is considered a library and provides the basic functionality to create UI by adding components to the project.
// React uses a language called JSX, which is a syntax type between JavaScript and HTML.
// JSX allows writing HTML within JavaScript code, making UI components more flexible and powerful.

// React uses state and props. State holds the state of a component and is used to change the state of the component. Props are used to pass data to a component.
// State management tools like Redux or ContextAPI can be used.
// Additional libraries can be used for tasks such as routing, state management, form handling, and API requests.

/*
Vue is used for both UI and application logic. This means there is no need to use additional libraries for tasks like routing, state management, form handling, and API requests.
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used in a more traditional way. Vue is easier to learn and enables faster development compared to React and Angular.
Vue's HTML templates resemble traditional HTML, making it easier for beginners to understand.

ECOSYSTEM: Vue.js has a smaller ecosystem compared to React and Angular. This means there are fewer third-party libraries and plugins available for Vue.js.
Vue CLI is the official CLI tool used to create Vue.js applications.
Vue Router, Vuex
is easier to learn.

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN REACT AND VUE
While Vue encompasses all features, React is used only for UI development.
React uses JSX, while Vue combines HTML and JavaScript files.
Performance: React performs well in large and complex applications, while Vue is more performant in small applications.

React: Suitable for large and complex applications. It offers extensive library support, flexibility, and customization options.
Vue: Suitable for small and medium-sized applications. It enables faster development with its less complex structure */
