# Package Managers

Package managers are tools used to manage and organize dependencies in software projects. They allow developers to easily install, update, and remove packages or libraries that their projects depend on. Package managers help streamline the development process by handling package versions, dependencies, and conflicts.

## NPM (Node Package Manager)

NPM is a popular package manager for Node.js projects. It comes bundled with Node.js installation. NPM allows you to manage, install, and integrate packages into your JavaScript projects. To create a `package.json` file, you can use the `npm init` command in your project directory. The `package.json` file contains information about your project, such as its name, version, and dependencies.

To install packages using NPM, you can use the `npm install` command followed by the package name. For example:
- `npm install react react-dom`
- `npm install react-router-dom`
- `npm install axios`
- `npm install mongoose`
- `npm install eslint --save-dev`


## PNPM

PNPM is another package manager for Node.js projects. It is developed as an alternative to NPM, offering faster installation and using less disk space. To install PNPM, you can use the command `npm install -g pnpm`. Similar to NPM, you can create a `package.json` file using the `pnpm init` command.

To install packages using PNPM, you can use the `pnpm install` command followed by the package name. For example:
- `pnpm install react react-dom`
- `pnpm install react-router-dom`
- `pnpm install axios`
- `pnpm install mongoose`
- `pnpm install eslint --save-dev`
