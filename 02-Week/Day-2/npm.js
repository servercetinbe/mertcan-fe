What is NPM?
NPM (Node Package Manager) is a package manager used to manage Node.js packages.
With NPM, you can manage, install, and integrate packages used in JavaScript projects.

NPM Installation
NPM comes with Node.js. So when you install Node.js, NPM is automatically installed as well.

npm init //used to create a package.json file.
npm init is used to create a package.json file in a project directory.
The package.json file is located in the root directory of a Node.js project and contains information about the project.
After running this command, you will be asked for information such as project name, version number, project description, etc.
Once you answer all the questions, a package.json file will be created.
