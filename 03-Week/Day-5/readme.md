# TypeScript Nedir, Ne İşe Yarar, Neden Kullanılır?

## What is TypeScript?
TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed by Microsoft that builds on JavaScript. TypeScript includes all the features of JavaScript and additionally offers static type checking and modern JavaScript features.

## What is it Used For?
TypeScript is used to make JavaScript code safer and more readable. With static type checking, you can detect potential errors while writing code and fix these errors during the compilation phase. Additionally, code written in TypeScript is compiled to JavaScript and can be run in any JavaScript environment.

## Why is it Used?
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript allows you to define the types of variables and functions through static type checking. This helps in early detection of errors.
- **Advanced IDE Support**: TypeScript supports advanced IDE features such as code completion, error detection, and refactoring.
- **Modern JavaScript Features**: TypeScript supports ES6 and newer JavaScript features, allowing you to use these features in older browsers.
- **Large Scale Projects**: TypeScript makes code more manageable and sustainable in large and complex projects.

TypeScript is preferred especially in large and complex projects because it makes the code safer, more readable, and more sustainable.

## Advantages Over JavaScript

- **Type Checking**: TypeScript adds a layer of security that JavaScript lacks through static type checking. This helps in early detection of errors and makes the code more reliable.
- **Code Completion and Refactoring**: TypeScript offers features like code completion and refactoring with advanced IDE support. This allows developers to work faster and more efficiently.
- **Modularity and Reusability**: TypeScript's modular structure makes the code more organized and reusable. This simplifies code management in large projects.
- **Backward Compatibility**: TypeScript supports modern JavaScript features and allows you to use these features in older browsers. This helps projects reach a wider audience.

Thanks to these advantages, TypeScript has become a preferred language especially in large and complex projects.
