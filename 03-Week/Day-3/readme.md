# Jest Testing Framework

## Introduction

Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity. It works with projects using Babel, TypeScript, Node.js, React, Angular, Vue.js, and more.


## Installation

To install Jest, run the following command:

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest
```

## Usage

To run tests with Jest, add the following script to your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
}
```

Then, you can run your tests using:

```bash
npm test
```

## Writing Tests

Create a test file with the `.test.js` or `.spec.js` extension. Here is an example:

```javascript
// sum.js
function sum(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
module.exports = sum;

// sum.test.js
const sum = require('./sum');

test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
    expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
});
```

## Conclusion

Jest is a powerful and easy-to-use testing framework for JavaScript applications. Its zero-configuration setup and rich feature set make it a great choice for both new and existing projects.
