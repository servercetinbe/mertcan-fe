# Authentication Strategies

## Topics Covered
1. **Implement JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication**
2. **Set up OAuth 2.0 for social logins (Google, Facebook, etc.)**
3. **Learn and apply Single Sign-On (SSO) basics**
4. **Explore session-based authentication**

## Detailed Breakdown

### 1. Implement JWT (JSON Web Token) Authentication
- Learn how to create and verify JWTs.
- Understand the benefits and use cases for JWTs.

### 2. Set up OAuth 2.0 for Social Logins
- Configure OAuth 2.0 for Google and Facebook.
- Understand the flow of OAuth 2.0 and its security implications.

### 3. Learn and Apply Single Sign-On (SSO) Basics
- Understand the principles of SSO.
- Implement SSO in a sample application.

### 4. Explore Session-Based Authentication
- Learn how to manage user sessions.
- Understand the pros and cons of session-based authentication.

## Differences Between Authentication Methods

### JWT (JSON Web Token) Authentication
- **Stateless**: JWTs are stateless, meaning the server does not need to store session information.
- **Scalability**: Easier to scale as the token is self-contained.
- **Security**: Tokens can be signed and optionally encrypted, but if compromised, they can be used until they expire.

### OAuth 2.0
- **Third-Party Access**: Allows users to grant third-party applications access to their resources without sharing credentials.
- **Complexity**: More complex to implement due to various flows and security considerations.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for scenarios where users need to log in using their social media accounts.

### Single Sign-On (SSO)
- **User Convenience**: Users can log in once and gain access to multiple applications.
- **Centralized Authentication**: Authentication is managed centrally, reducing the need for multiple credentials.
- **Implementation**: Requires integration with an identity provider.

### Session-Based Authentication
- **Stateful**: The server maintains session information, typically stored in memory or a database.
- **Security**: Sessions can be invalidated on the server side, providing better control.
- **Scalability**: Can be challenging to scale due to the need to manage session state.
