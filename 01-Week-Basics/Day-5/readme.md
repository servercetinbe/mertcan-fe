Agile vs Scrum vs Kanban

What is Agile?
Agile is a project management methodology that is flexible, fast, and adaptable to continuous change in software development processes. Agile enables the development of products based on customer requirements in short cycles. The main goal is to quickly respond to customer needs and continuously improve products.
Key Principles of Agile:
Individuals and interactions are more important than processes and tools.
Working software is more important than comprehensive documentation.
Collaboration with the customer is more important than contract negotiation.
Being able to respond to change is more important than following a plan.

What is Scrum?
Scrum is one of the most popular frameworks of Agile. It breaks down the project into small, manageable pieces and works on them in time periods called "Sprints". Scrum requires regular meetings and a team with clear roles.

Scrum Roles:
Product Owner: Determines and prioritizes the business needs of the project.
Scrum Master: Ensures the team follows Scrum rules, removes obstacles, and supports the team's efficient work.
Development Team: Members of the team who develop, test, and sustain the project.

Scrum Processes:
Sprint Planning: Planning meeting held before each Sprint.
Daily Standup Meetings: Short meetings held every day to review the team's tasks for the day.
Sprint Review: Review of the product at the end of the Sprint and gathering feedback.
Sprint Retrospective: Meeting where the team evaluates the previous Sprint and discusses improvements.

What is Kanban?
Kanban is a project management methodology that visualizes the workflow and helps manage tasks. Based on continuous improvement, Kanban focuses on the continuous flow of work rather than fixed time periods like Scrum.

Kanban Board:
To Do: Column for tasks that have not yet started.
In Progress: Column for tasks currently being worked on.
Done: Column for completed tasks.

Agile, Scrum, and Kanban are methodologies that enable flexible, efficient, and customer-focused work in software development processes. These methodologies can be chosen based on the project size, team structure, and needs. While Scrum is a structured and process-oriented methodology, Kanban is more flexible and flow-based. Agile, as the foundation of both, focuses on continuous improvement and customer satisfaction.
